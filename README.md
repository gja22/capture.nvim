# capture.nvim

Capture various types of notes in neovim.

Inspired by the Zettelkasten method.

## Use Case

I like to take simple text notes for the most part. The reason for this is that
the notes are easily portable between systems and I can build tools to process
my notes. I also like to use the Vim (now Neovim) editor.

I have landed on (essentially) the Zettelkasten method of compiling notes, but
in the workplace I also add things like 1-1s and meeting notes. It's a
compilation of everything going on, not only a knowledgebase used to spark new
ideas.

This plugin (to date) is an efficiency tool to quickly generate new files based
on a template for various types of entries.

It needs more tools, especially to manage tags and to link easily to other
entries. Extending Telescope looks promising and I may end up writing my own
tools as my Neovim and Lua knowledge grows.

## Notes

### Note 1

This is very specific to how I like to work. It's part Zettelkasten, part
practices I have evolved over the years, and part my quirky style.

I'm not recommending that anyone follow this, but you might get some useful
ideas.

### Note 2

This is my first neovim plugin and my Lua experience is minimal (some Redis and
Nginx scripting, but nothing close to a real program). As such, I really don't
know what I'm doing and I'm using this as a learning experience. Please don't
assume that anything I've done in here is the "right" way to approach the
problem, it's high unlikely that is the case.

### Note 3

You can probably do what I've done here with a good snippet tool. Snippets will
definitely be useful or working with common text within entries and I'm sure I
will add some of those, but I did not know if snippets can create new files.
Something I will look into.
